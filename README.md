# Binary Search Tree

*This code is posted with instructor permission, and adheres to school policy.

Assignment Summary:

1.	Implement a "Thing" class (I used Guitars).
2.	ThingNode: a linked list Node where the data part is of type "Thing".
3.	ThingLinkedBag: a collection of "Things" in which the elements are stored in an unordered linked list.
4.	ThingLinkedBagDriver: includes a main method to test the functionality of your collection.

Requirements for Node and Tree:
    1) Store data in a recursive binary search tree data structure according to the binary search tree principles.
    2) Store data in a Node, which must contain an object of your "Thing".
    3) Create your own Node class and its methods.
    4) Binary Search Tree class must be separate from Node class and implement recursive methods.
    5) Implement encapsulation by having a clean separation between the Node and binary search tree classes.
    6) Use a linked implementation.
